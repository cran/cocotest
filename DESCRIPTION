Description: A common misconception is that the Hochberg procedure comes up with adequate overall type I error control when test statistics are positively correlated. However, unless the test statistics follow some standard distributions, the Hochberg procedure requires a more stringent positive dependence assumption, beyond mere positive correlation, to ensure valid overall type I error control. To fill this gap, we formulate statistical tests grounded in rank correlation coefficients to validate fulfillment of the positive dependence through stochastic ordering (PDS) condition.
